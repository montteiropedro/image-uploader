<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

  I really learned more about the **HTML Input** of type **file** in this challenge. That was the first time where I took my time on learning and understanding about how it works, how to stylize it and add more functionality like the drag and drop support. That was a fun project, simple but also not so simple (as I didn't really knew how to use this type of input properly haha).

  Well, I guess I will not be so lost the next time I'm required to implement this type of input.

<!-- - Where can I see your demo? -->

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

- The user can drag and drop an image to upload it
- The user can choose to select an image from my folder
- The user can see a loader when uploading
- When the image is uploaded, the user can see the image and copy it
- The user can choose to copy to the clipboard

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository (via HTTPS or SSH)
$ git clone https://github.com/montteiropedro/image-uploader.git
$ git clone git@github.com:montteiropedro/image-uploader.git
```

Now you gonna have to navigate inside the project folder and there you gonna have two separate folders, ***web*** and ***server***. Inside each of these folders you will find files named `.env.example`, and from them you can easily configure your environment variables. Don't forget to rename these files to just `.env`, only then they will be functional.

After this we must install ***web*** and ***server*** dependencies. We can do this by entering each of these folders and running the following command:  

```bash
# Install dependencies (You must do this step inside the `web` and `server` folders separately)
$ npm install
```

Still running the commands for each of these 2 folders separately, you can have:

```bash
# Run app in localhost
npm run dev

# Compile and Build the app
npm run build

# Run the app
$ npm start
```
